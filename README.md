# Probability of Overlap
Here is a repository of the code I wrote that was used in my analysis of a chance overlap between SwiftJ1728 and SNR G351.9. To use this code, please download all the files in this repository. The .csv are all catalogs from Milky Way distributions in a variety of formats that made it easier for me to read in the data.

We used Milky Way supernova remnant (SNR) (Green 2019), high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB) (Liu et al. 2006),
low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) (Liu et al. 2007), and black hole (BH) (Corral-Santana et al. 2016) catalogs to get
positions of all known SNRs, XRBs, and BHs in the galaxy. The SNR and BH catalogs contained distances, but the
LMXB and HMXB catalogs did not. For the X-ray binaries, we used distances from Coleiro & Chaty 2013 and Jonker &
Nelemans 2004.

The .ipynb file has some comments. If you have questions or have ideas on how to get the code to run faster, feel free to contact me at bmayura@umich.edu
